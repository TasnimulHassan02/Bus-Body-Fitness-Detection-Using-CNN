# Bus-Body-Fitness-Detection-Using-CNN
We built a model which predicts whether a bus is fit or unfit.
# Bus Body Fitness Detection Model - README

## Overview
The ** Bus Body Fitness Detection** project is a machine learning-based system designed to detect and evaluate the fitness of vehicles, particularly buses, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project aims to contribute to safer and more efficient public transportation by automating the vehicle fitness evaluation process.

## Features
- **Fitness Detection**: Analyzes images of buses to assess their overall condition and fitness.
- **Deep Learning-Powered**: Employs CNN architecture for high accuracy in detecting and classifying vehicle conditions.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to include other vehicle types in the future.

## Results
Add the performance metrics and evaluation results here. For example:
- Accuracy: 95%
- Precision: 92%
- Recall: 94%
